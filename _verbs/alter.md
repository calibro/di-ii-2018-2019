Starting from the observations made during the first exercise, the students had to choose a digital platform and modify the visual elements of a graphical interface through a Firefox web extension. The goal is to problematize some aspects of the platform (such as gamification and the user attention exploitation) through a process of hiding, exposing or semantically hacking some elements of the interface.

1. Choose a digital platform
2. Think about how to alter the UI through the browser inspector or a mockup up
3. Describe what the extension will do in one sentence
4. Code the web extension starting from the boilerplate
5. Publish the extension and make it available through a one page website
6. Add a video which explains how the extension works
