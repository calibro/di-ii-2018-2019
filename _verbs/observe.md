Observe, deconstruct and describe extensively what you see while you are performing an action on a digital platform. The goal is to exhaust every single element of a graphical user interface and, by isolating them from the context, be able to better describe how they influences the way we use a digital platform.

1. Choose an action to perform on digital platform
2. Take screenshots of the interface for each step
3. Describe extensively what you see while you are performing your action through a diegetic text
4. Create a web page that combines text and images.
