title: Interface Design II at ISIA Urbino — Academic year 2018–2019
id: index
---

Everyday we interact with a complex system of infrastructures, technologies, algorithms, corporations, individuals, data, protocols, and more, through digital interfaces. Phones, computers and other interconnected devices **mediate behaviours**, encourage interactions and influence the way we see and experience the world around us.

The role of designers is usually focused on making these interactions as **frictionless** and **smooth** as possible, to create a never-ending data exchange process that generates value.

The course aims at reframing **the interface as a cultural and political object**.
The students are invited to experiment different **methods and practices to approach and explore the relationship between interfaces, data and algorithms**.
Each chapter of the course revolves around a **specific action** and produces a **different output** in order to develop different skills and methodologies.
