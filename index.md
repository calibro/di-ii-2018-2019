id: index
---

Everyday we interact with a complex system of infrastructures, technologies, algorithms, corporations, individuals, data, protocols, and more, through digital interfaces. Phones, computers and other interconnected devices mediate behaviours, encourage interactions and influence the way we see and experience the world around us. 
The role of designers is usually focused on making these interactions as frictionless and smooth as possible, to create a never-ending data exchange process that generates value. 
The course aims at experimenting with **methods and practices to approach and explore the relationship between interfaces, data and algorithms**. Each chapter of the course revolves around a specific action and produces a different output in order to develop different skills and methodologies.
